<ul>
  <li>Building design and operation impact  the accumulation  and survival of microorganisms in indoor spaces.</li>
  <li>These microorganisms, together referred to as the indoor microbiome,  have implications for human health and well being.</li>
  <li>Understanding the relative importance  of factors that shape the indoor microbiome may inform how to optimize building design and use for human health and safety.</li>
  <li>This study aimed to identify putative  sources of microbes found in dust in athletic facilities  and determine  the building characteristics  that most strongly correlate with the human-derived  content.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="methods--initial-results">Methods &amp; Initial Results</h2>
<p>Dust samples collected (n=122)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/human-derived-content-of-dust-1.png" alt="Figure 1" class="align-center" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Asociations between estimated proportions of human-derived microbiota and building properties were evaluated  with beta regression.</li>
  <li>SourceTracker data were also compared with a culture-dependent assessment of dust microbial diversity.</li>
  <li>Approximately 31.5±2.2% of the dust microbiota were putatively  derived from humans, primarily  skin (e.g., Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="factors-associated-with-putative-sources-of-dust-microbiota">Factors Associated with Putative Sources of Dust Microbiota</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Dispersal</em></strong> is a major driver of the indoor microbiome;  the heterogeneous microbial communities  consisted of few dominant and many low-abundance taxa coming from a mix of sources (19.8±0.8 genera per sample). Bolded genera are human-derived.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Spaces with operable windows or exterior doors had significantly lower proportions of human-sourced microbiota (p=0.013), suggesting a strong effect of <em><strong>ventilation</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/human-derived-content-of-dust-4.png" alt="Figure 4" class="align-center" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Expectedly, <em><strong>human occupancy</strong></em> positively correlated with proportion of human-derived microbiota  (r=0.346, p=0.042).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/human-derived-content-of-dust-5.png" alt="Figure 5" class="align-center" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Weak positive correlations between consumer product-associated antimicrobials in dust and putative microbiota  sources suggest potential  co-transport from human skin.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Chemical cleaning frequency</strong></em> correlated with increases as well (p=0.001). This may suggest that human-associated microbes are more tolerant  of cleaning chemicals than environmental-sourced  (e.g., soil, water) microbes. Alternatively, maybe spaces that are cleaned more frequently are also used more often, thus allowing for deposition of more human-derived microbes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We found a weak negative correlation  between human-associatedness and culture richness (β=-0.194, p=0.017), suggesting that <em><strong>environmental taxa are more viable</strong></em> or that our culture methods may have been biased.</p>
  </li>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Formation of the indoor microbiome involves passive transport of microbes and potential interaction with chemicals from human skin.</li>
  <li>This process is dominated by dispersal, though potential  impacts of cleaning and personal hygiene products may increase in spaces with limited  windows and exterior doors, especially  as spaces become more crowded.</li>
  <li>Future studies will focus on specific mechanisms for adaptations in the indoor microbiome and implications  for human health (e.g., antibiotic  resistance dissemination).</li>
</ul>
