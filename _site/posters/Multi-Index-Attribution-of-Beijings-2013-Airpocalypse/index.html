<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>We use an attribution framework developed by Dienbaugh et al. (2017), in which we evaluate the change in event magnitude from the observed timeseries to the detrended timeseries (A), the change in return interval (B) from the observed to the detrended timeseries (C) and from the pre-industrial to the historical simulations (D, F), and the likelihood of the observed trend in the historical and pre-industrial simulations (E).</p>

<p>We use the CESM Large Ensemble, a set of 30 realizations with dierent initial conditions, to generate a sample of the historical climate from 1979 to 2005 (Kay et al., 2015). The simulation is extended to 2016 by adding the first ten years of the corresponding RCP8.5 realization. This accounts for internal variability that may bias a single realization and more fully covers the probability space of the historical climate. We use the Large Ensemble’s pre-industrial control realization from 402-2200 to assess change from the pre-industrial to the historical climate.</p>

<p>Observations are drawn from the NCEP R1 reanalysis project, calculated over the period from 1979-2016. We use January monthly-mean data for the PPI, DJF daily data for the HWI, and annual daily data for the ASI, following the methods used when each index was originated.</p>

<p>We also extract the Air Temperature Gradient Index, a component of the PPI, to measure the spatial patterns of temperature inversions in the Beijing area. Inversions are dened using self-organizing map cluster analysis, which provides a set of the typical temperature gradient patterns in each simulation (Horton et al., 2015). We use a three-node confguration to represent the temperature gradient: a highly unstable atmosphere, a neutral gradient, and a highly stable atmosphere. The algorithm is trained on the observations, and the resulting patterns are applied to the simulations. We then apply the attribution metrics to the timeseries of maximum duration of node 3, as a proxy for the intensity of signifcant inversions over the Beijing area.</p>
