abstract: "Our research group is currently working to develop the first cross-culturally validated household water insecurity scale. In order to do this, we have partnered with numerous collaborators to implement the survey in diverse ecological settings. As part of the survey, participants are asked to recall how long it takes to travel to their primary water source and the number of trips they make each week. Using this information, I created a figure that is intended to convey the number of hours individuals spend fetching water each week, by site. This information is critical for testing the validity of our survey, but can also be used as a tool to motivate policymakers and researchers to explore the topic of water insecurity in greater depth given its clear opportunity costs."
