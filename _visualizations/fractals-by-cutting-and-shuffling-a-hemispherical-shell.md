abstract: "A fractal is created by a Piecewise Isometry (PWI) which cuts a 2D object into pieces and rearranges those pieces to recreate the original object in a scrambled form. The PWI studied here splits a hemispherical shell into four pieces along cutting lines and rearranges them into a shuffled hemisphere. The cuts of the PWI create an intricate fractal. Videos require highly parallel computation using a GPU to repeat the PWI an adequate number of times to resolve the fractal. The persistence of cut-less regions at all scales confirms the fractal structure and offers insight into the mixing behavior of the PWI, which can be used to help design efficient mixing systems.

#### Description
A fractal has an intricate structure no matter how closely one looks at it. This video zooms in on fractal details formed by repeatedly cutting a hemispherical shell into moon-shaped wedges and rearranging them into a scrambled hemisphere. Funded by [NSF CMMI 1435065](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1435065).
