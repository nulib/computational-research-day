abstract: "Mixing due to cutting-and-shuffling is studied at a fundamental level using 2D mappings known as Piecewise Isometries (PWI) which can create beautiful mixing patterns. The PWI studied here splits a hemispherical shell (HS) into four curved triangular pieces that are rearranged to make a shuffled HS. Applying the PWI repeatedly (1, 20, and 20,000 times) to an initial condition (left) reveals circular regions devoid of mixing and regions that appear well-mixed (gray), the size of which determine how well the HS is mixed. PWI operations on initial conditions like those shown require highly parallel computation on a GPU to allow adequate repetition to resolve mixing patterns. The behavior of PWIs can be used to design efficient mixing systems. Funded by NSF CMMI 1435065."

### Description
Intricate mixing patterns emerge when a hemisphere (viewed from below) is repeatedly cut into four pieces and rearranged (shuffled). The hemisphere mixes in some regions (gray) but not in others. Funded by [NSF CMMI 1435065](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1435065).
