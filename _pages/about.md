Computational Research Day is an all-day symposium which brings together students, faculty, and researchers across fields and disciplines to share and promote their experiences and efforts in digital research. Through a broad range of activities, we explore topics including research reproducibility in computational science, data management and data science challenges, research communication, and much more. The umbrella of themes includes high performance and parallel computing, creating and working with large data sets, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and computer vision and visualization. The event also provides networking opportunities for faculty, graduate students, undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and staff.

Northwestern Computational Research Day is hosted by Northwestern Information Technology and sponsored by Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, Kellogg School of Management, Feinberg School of Medicine, Office for Research, The Graduate School, Northwestern University Libraries, CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics), and NICO (Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems).
