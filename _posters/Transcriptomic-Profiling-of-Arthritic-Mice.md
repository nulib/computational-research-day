abstract: "We have previously developed a mouse model called HUPO (CD11c-Flip-KO), where the mice spontaneously develop inflammatory arthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis, one of the prevalent autoimmune diseases. We observed that the compositions of synovial macrophage populations, where they are classified into 5 subsets (IIa, IIb, IIc, Ib, Ia) based on surface markers CD11b, F4/80, and Ly6C in healthy mice, were notably altered in HUPO mice compared to control. Here, we performed RNA-seq on blood monocytes and the synovial macrophage populations isolated from HUPO and control mice with the following objectives: 1.	To better characterize each macrophage population (IIa, IIb, IIc, Ib, Ia) and infer the differentiation relationships between each other in healthy mice. 2.	Interrogate the effects of inflammatory arthritis (HUPO) on each population and their relationships and identify key genes and pathways responsible for the effects. We found that in healthy mice, IIa cells are the most similar to classical monocytes and Ia macrophages seems to be the most tissue-resident, while the other cell types are in between, suggesting that the synovial macrophage populations represent a spectrum of homeostatic monocyte to resident macrophage differentiation. We also observed that all cell types became more similar to monocytes in HUPO, with Ia/Ib macrophages losing their tissue-resident signature. Finally, IIc cellsâ€™ expressions seemed to be altered the most in response to HUPO, and further investigations into that specific cell type can perhaps inform us more on the biological process."
