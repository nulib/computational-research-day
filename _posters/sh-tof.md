abstract: "Three-dimensional imaging techniques have been widely used in both industry and academia. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors offer a promising method of 3D imaging due to compact size and slow complexity. However, state-of-the-art ToF sensors only have depth resolutions of centimeters due to limitations in the modulation frequencies that can be used. In this paper, we propose a technique to generate modulation frequencies as high as 1 THz using optical superheterodyne interferometry. Our proposed system provides great flexibility in imaging range and resolution. We experimentally demonstrate an increase in depth resolution by an order of magnitude relative to currently available commercial ToF cameras."

### Motivation

**Why ToF cameras for 3D imaging?**
- Large baseline for comparable depth resolution (Triangulation based 3D imaging e.g. structure light camera)
- ToF cameraâ€™s compact size

**Problem with current ToF cameras**

**Our motivation: build a depth camera with micro resolution**

### Background & Proposed

**ToF camera**

![Figure 3](/assets/images/2018/sh-tof-3.png){: .align-center}

- Meters image range but centimeters depth resolution

**Michelson Interferometry (MI)**

![Figure 4](/assets/images/2018/sh-tof-4.png){: .align-center}

- Micro depth resolution but micro image range
- Not able to image optical rough surface (laser speckle)

**SH-ToF (Our propose)**

![Figure 5](/assets/images/2018/sh-tof-5.png){: .align-center}

- Micro depth resolution but tunable image range (micro to meters)
- **Able** to image optical rough surface (laser speckle)

### Comparison & Contributions

**Our Contributions**
- Micro resolution
- Tunability between depth resolution and depth range
- 3D scanning on rough surface
